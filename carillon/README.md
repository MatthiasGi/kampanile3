# Carillon for GrandOrgue

This carillon is based on the Ghent Belfry Carillon. It builds ontop of the work
described here: <http://duphly.free.fr/en/carillon.html>

To use it, you need to download the sound-files from the mentioned site and
extract the bell-sounds into the `sounds/` directory. The carillon can then be
used with [GrandOrgue](https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue).

The provided `organ`-file virtually supplements missing bells between A#0 and
D1. Furthermore an enclosure is added to allow the control of the bells' volume.
